# Hello!
This is a custom bow template built off of a commission job that i did.

TypeScript files are in ``scripts``, JS files are in ``BP/scripts``. 


## This is confusing, what files do i actually need?
The only files that you need for this to work is everything that's in the ``BP`` and ``RP``.

## Ending Statement
Special thanks to Trey (treysundown). He is the person that gave me this commission job.

As i said earlier, this pack was built off of a commission that i worked on for a day or 2.
Without commissions, this template that i made would not exist(or atleast, not for a while).
Commissions, MP work, and my personal addons are the only ways that i am making money at the moment, so thank you all for the support!
